    <h1>About Lead Poisoning in Oakland</h1>
    <p  class="tab">Each year, around 1 million people pass away from lead poisoning. Children, especially those under the age of 6, are experiencing damage from fatal levels of lead poisoning. Oakland’s poverty-stricken residents are at an extremely high risk of lead poisoning. This means that lead contamination in Oakland, especially low-income neighborhoods, is an extremely dangerous hazard. These high levels of lead have the ability to cause irreversible damage to health, lifelong neurological damage, and 800 million adolescents are affected by this. It is wrong because lead poisoning can cause damage to a child’s neurological health. </p>
  <p class="tab" >	Lead is primarily deposited from old paint chips, lead dust in soil, and small
aircraft fuel. According to Mayo Clinic, lead poisoning has been prevalent in paint before 1978, when the government had allowed lead in paint (Mayo Clinic 2022). Alameda County’s government has stated that more than 85 percent of the houses constructed in Oakland were built before 1940. This means that lead is heavily concentrated within the walls of an Oakland household, where lead-based paint is slathered. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, lead dust in soil primarily consists of mobilized lead chips from leaded gasoline. This poses a hazard to children who play near soil or on lawns. Additionally, according to NBC news, lead content is still present in small aircraft fuel. This means that citizens that cannot afford to pay for better air quality are forced to move into residential areas that are prominent in lead contaminated air. </p>

<p class="tab" >	In conformity with Karen Boyd, “The 15 census tracts where the most lead poisoned children were found are primarily in San Antonio, Fruitvale, and East Oakland, which are predominantly Latinx, Black and Asian, and have a confluence of low household incomes, older rental properties, substandard housing conditions, concentrations of older housing, and a high percentage of low-income families with children under the age of six. (Boyd 2021)” This information shows that lead poisoning in Oakland is highly concentrated within communities that primarily consist of people of color. </p>

	<p class="tab">Lead poisoning can be controlled by painting over old paint, covering contaminated soil with dense grass or mulch, and implementing HEPA air purifiers into homes. Lead poisoning in old paint can be covered by encapsulation. Encapsulation is a process where old paint is covered by paint encapsulants to safely preserve the old paint from chipping off, equipping a “barrier” between the paint and its surroundings (New York Department of Health 2018). Additionally, when lead levels are high in soil, spreading a thick layer of healthy mulch or grass can prevent the contact of lead to spread to children. Some possible things to layer on top of soil are mulch, wood chips, concrete, sod, grass, and sand. All materials must be at least 3-4 inches off from the lead soil to maximize the cover of the lead soil. Another method to cleanse the environment of lead dust is to install HEPA air purifiers. HEPA air purifiers are expensive but an effective way in filtering air with lead particles in it. HEPA air purifiers are designed to hold extremely tiny particles, and so lead dust in the household will not be as big of a concern when HEPA air purifiers have the ability to filter the impurities. </p>
	<p class="tab" >Although many people may believe that lead contamination is not significant, it can
severely impact the youth of our communities. Many citizens may believe that it is better to leave the damages done to impoverished neighborhoods as it is because it is much cheaper to not spend money repairing these environments. However, It is much better to invest money into these struggling communities because of the damage it does to children at a young age. Young people of color and impoverished individuals will be vulnerable to lead impurities in their living environment as a consequence if this is not mended. </p>
<p class="tab" >	     It has taken a long time for lead during history to be banned in products ever since it was implemented into products, and the effects of this has negatively impacted many youth with widespread neurological disorders and respiratory issues. Some solutions to this problem is to implement HEPA air purifiers into houses and to increase enforcement of safe federal regulations of renovations, fixing, and painting. If the lead contaminated communities do not experience change, it has the potential to negatively affect vulnerable children under 6 years of age.
